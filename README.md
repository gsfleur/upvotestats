# Upvote Stats

Upvote Stats is a free and open-source website that grants users the ability to determine the amount of upvotes, downvotes, awards, and estimated earnings each subreddit accumulated in the past 30 days.

Please note that the data, for such active sites, is constantly changing so please don't depend on receiving complete accuracy if using the report for something significant.

By default, only the most recent one hundred top posts from this past month are analyzed for the convenience of processing time. However, you can click the 'Load more data' button at the top of each page to continue processing even more data in order to achieve the best results.

If you encounter any issues or bugs, please refer to the Twitter link in the footer as a means for contact.
